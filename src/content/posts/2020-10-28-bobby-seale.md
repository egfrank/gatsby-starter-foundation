Critics are, if not quite raving about, enjoying The Trial of the Chicago 7. Aaron Sorkin, having learned about the 1968 Democratic National Convention from Steven Spielberg in 2006, has forged a courtroom drama from the major events of the resulting trial, where eight left-wing activists were charged with conspiring to start a riot. It’s acknowledged that the movie takes its liberties with the historical record, but the resulting writing is pointed and energetic, and the performances of the ensemble cast are said to capture the real-life bravado of such figures as Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron-Cohen) and Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong).

  Critics have had comparatively little to say about Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who plays Bobby Seale, cofounder and Chairman of the Black Panther party. This is likely because Bobby Seale, despite being the most interesting character of the first half of the film, is absent from the film’s end. Seale was the eighth defendant in the Chicago conspiracy trial, but in November 1969 his case was declared a mistrial and severed from that of the remaining seven defendants. Once Seale exits, the focus of the film turns towards the rift between Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman, and the film never makes up its mind as to how Bobby Seale’s story is related to the story of the Chicago Seven.  
  
  This is a shame, because the themes of the movie ¬– political repression from the justice system, the importance of protest, the challenges of solidarity – are all most clearly told in the story of Bobby Seale. Seale was shoehorned into the trial to impede his organizing with the Black Panthers, which the FBI had called “the greatest threat to internal security of the country.” The conspiracy charges against Seale were on their face ridiculous in light of the fact that Seale had not met the seven other members of the defense before the trial. To make matters worse, Seale’s lawyer, Charles Garry, was undergoing gallbladder surgery in California, and his motion to postpone the trial was denied by Judge Hoffman. The judge, failing to conceal his disdain for the defendant, repeatedly insisted that William Kunstler was the lawyer for Seale; Seale in turn insisted he was not.

After his demand for his lawyer was repeatedly denied, Seale requested to act as his own lawyer and cross-examine witnesses. Seale attempted in good faith to develop a legal defense for himself: he received legal advice from Garry, asked Judge Hoffman to coach him in the procedure of cross-examination, and argued for his right to defend himself with a special Reconstruction law affirming a Black man’s right to equal protection under the law. When these demands were also denied, Seale responded to the arbitrariness of the judge by calling him a blatant racist and fascist. Seale was, as the prosecution’s lawyer put it, “a very effective speaker,”  and his performance in the courtroom was a mix of legal reasoning and political rallying. A journalist at the trial stated “there were times when it seemed that there was only one relationship in the courtroom, the struggle between Bobby Seale and Judge Hoffman.”

  So it is no surprise that Abdul-Mateen II’s scenes are some of the most engaging in the film, especially when they stay true to Seale’s actual courtroom performance. Yet Abdul-Mateen II often substitutes righteous anger in place of Seale’s coolness, cunning, and persistence. The Bobby Seale of the movie seethes and stares down the racist judge, he raises his voice to appeal to the courtroom audience, he pounds the table and is taken away by the marshals.  While Abdul-Mateen II’s performance is laudable, the film does not quite convey that Seale’s actions in the trial were part of a deliberate, studied strategy. Nor are Seale’s political beliefs ever elaborated. At times, Seale makes appeals to anti-racism generally, such as when he alludes to lynching in speaking to Tom Hayden, but the political goals of the Panthers – anti-poverty, community control of the police – are never broached in the film.
  
And so while the film is generally sympathetic to the Panthers, it shows no real interest in their history. The film’s most dramatic factual error is its placement of Fred Hampton’s murder. Fred Hampton, the leader of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, was assassinated on December 4, 1969 in a 4am police raid on his house organized by the FBI and the Cook County State's Attorney's Office. This was a month after Bobby Seale was already severed from the trial; in fact, footage exists of Fred Hampton speaking outside of the Conspiracy trial, telling a crowd about the “physical and mental torture” the judge was inflicting on Seale.

 The film appropriates Hampton’s murder for its own narrative by imagining it took place a month earlier. Seale learns about the murder of Hampton in jail and still must participate in the trial that day. In the courtroom, he continues to advocate for himself, but his patience is exhausted. After a final row with the judge over his right to cross-examine witnesses, he stands, turns towards the courtroom audience, and shouts “it was premeditated murder... Fred Hampton was assassinated last night.” The fictionalized scene segues back into historical fact as Seale, as a result of his outburst, is ordered by the judge to be gagged, chained to his chair, and brought back into the courtroom. But by shifting the timeline, the movie imagines that Seale being gagged and bound was a consequence of his emotions, not the result of his consistent struggle for the acknowledgement of his constitutional rights. 

Seale continued to struggle throughout the three days of the trial that he remained gagged and bound, interjecting when he felt he was being misrepresented and shouting down the judge when his gag happened to slip. Outside of the trial, courtroom sketches of Seale were disseminated as a powerful symbol of the fascism of the judge and the Nixon administration. After three days, Judge Hoffman came to terms with the fact that gagging Seale was both ineffective and a political windfall for the Panthers; on the next Monday, Seale’s restraints were removed, and a day later his case was declared a mistrial. 

The declaration of a mistrial is shown as a political win for Seale in the film, but the real-life consequences for Seale were much more ambiguous. He ended the case with 16 charges of contempt of court, for which the judge sentenced him to an unprecedented four years in prison. Seale was the only member of the Chicago Eight to be incarcerated as a result of the case, but this fact goes unmentioned in the film. Once Seale exits the trial he is not heard from again. Bobby Seale, whose central conflict in the film is his desire to be heard fairly by the judge, exits the movie with the gag still firmly in his mouth.
