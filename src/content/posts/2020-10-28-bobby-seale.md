Aaron Sorkin’s film The Trial of the Chicago Seven, recently released to Netflix, dramatizes the 1969 trial of eight activists who either planned or participated in the anti-Vietnam protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. It is a fun and politically incoherent film, where the actual transcript of the trial is mostly replaced by Sorkin’s dialogue. Out of the eight, Sorkin’s favored protagonist is Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), the SDS leader who over the course of the film clashes with  Abbie Hoffman’s (Sacha Baron Cohen) understanding that their current case is a political trial. In the climax of the film, Hayden interrupts the judge to read a list of American soldiers who had died in Vietnam, an event created by Sorkin to demonstrate Hayden’s newfound appreciation of Hoffman’s view that the political stakes of their trial necessitated political theater and protest.

The real life Bobby Seale entered the Chicago Conspiracy trial with an understanding that a trial could be a political sham and still have life-altering consequences for its defendants. Seale entered the trial in chains, driven for \[xx] days from San Francisco in a police convoy despite orders that \[xxx].

The film includes some of the notable facts about Seale’s court case. The conspiracy charges against Seale were on their face ridiculous considering the fact that Seale had never met any of the seven other members of the defense before the trial. Seale’s lawyer, Charles Garry, a white man who had become the Black Panthers chief legal counsel through defending \[xxx], was undergoing gall bladder surgery in California and therefore unavailable to defend Seale. The judge, failing to conceal his disdain for the defendant, repeatedly insisted that William Kunstler was the lawyer for Seale; Seale in turn insisted he was not.
	
To understand how the Seale of the film differed from the real-life Seale’s performance in the courtyard, it is necessary to read the trial transcripts, or even watch the Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8. Where The Trial of the Chicago 7 \[xxx], Conspiracy attempts to preserve the historical significance of the trial as closely as possible, with dialogue taken directly from the trial transcripts and voice-over from all eight of the real-life defendants, who appear in talking head interviews that are overlaid on the screen. Watching Conspiracy one learns that Bobby Seale’s performance in the courtroom differed significantly from the reserved, seething performance that Yahya Mateen-Taurus II delivers. Seale understood that, in own words, he was being railroaded by the judge and deprived of his constitutional rights to determine his own lawyer. His response was a barrage of speech. When his name was mentioned by a witness’ testimony, he would declare he was missing his lawyer. When his demand for his lawyer was denied, he began to demand to act as his own lawyer and cross-examine witnesses; when these demands were also met with protest by the judge, he would call him a racist and fascist. Seale’s effort to defend himself was not facile; he received legal documents from the BPP and a legal student attending the trial.
